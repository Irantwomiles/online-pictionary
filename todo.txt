Server:
    - Game:
        * Start handling game logic
            - Rounds
            - Guessing
            - etc
    - Clean Up:
        * There is probably lots of code that isn't being used or is repetitive and can be replaced with newer code.
            - replace the "users" constant with our new Object
            - find a better way to handle "add-user" so that we don't have to use the "login" event.

Client:
    - Start the actual design once finished with the backend.
