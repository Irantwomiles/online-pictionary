    - Game:
        * Start handling game logic
            - Start
                * Pick Drawer
                * Give the option of 3 words to the drawer to pick from
                    - Start timer when word is chosen
                * Prevent others from drawing
            - Correct Guess
                * Check if word they guessed is Correct
                * Give them the score they got 
                * After everyone guesses right, end game and go to next person


    - Clean Up:
        * There is probably lots of code that isn't being used or is repetitive and can be replaced with newer code.
            - replace the "users" constant with our new Object
            - find a better way to handle "add-user" so that we don't have to use the "login" event.

Client:
    - Start the actual design once finished with the backend.
